        <h2>Text Design</h2>
        <p>Differentiating important pieces of text, such as titles and subtitles, is an effective way of
            achieving this.</p>
        <p>You can guide a user through your site by creating contrast with headings, subheading, and lists
            (ordered or unordered).</p>
        <p>As a best practice, the following HTML elements are used to differentiate text into categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt;h1&gt; - used for <strong>titles</strong>. You should have one header of this style per page.</li>
            <li>&lt;h2&gt; - used for <strong>headings</strong>. This should be to identify major sections you want
                the user to immediately be drawn towards.</li>
            <li>&lt;h2&gt; - used for <strong>subheadings</strong>. This should be used for smaller focal points,
                such as articles, that you want the user to notice when scanning the page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fonts also play a useful role in differentiating text when used sparingly. It is effective to have a
            different font for a page title, and perhaps a third font for certain subheaders. But be warned, if
            you differentiate each paragraph with a new font or have a different font for every level of header
            your page will quickly become muddled and hard to read.</p>
        <p>It often works well to have most of your text in a serif font, and then create contrast with headings or
            subheadings in a sans-serif font, but this can vary based on how you’d like the page to be styled.
            The most important thing is that the fonts you have complement each other appropriately.</p>
        <p>In addition to fonts and headers, you can contrast between different pieces of text in a number of ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Style</li>
            <li>Size</li>
            <li>Weight</li>
            <li>Color</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Whitespace</h2>
        <p>The whitespace on your page is just as important to the text design of your site as the text itself.
            Without proper spacing and balance, your text can be rendered virtually illegible.</p>
        <p>Types of whitespace within the text:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Line spacing</strong>: also known as <i>Leading</i>, refers to the distance between two lines
                of text. Adjusting this value has a huge impact on the legibility of your site.</li>
        </ul>

        </figure>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tracking</strong>: is the space between the letters and the words. If you have too little
                tracking, the words will appear cramped, so by increasing tracking slightly, you make your text
                significantly more legible.</li>
        </ul>

            <figcaption>Explaining tracking.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kerning</strong>: is the space between two letters in the text. You typically will not need
                to worry about kerning because a well-designed typeface already has optimal kerning built in.
                It is most important when you want to adjust the kerning in a title or header to achieve the design
                you want. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Text Readability</h2>
        <p>It should be a pleasant experience for users to read the text on your website.
            Here are some easy ways to accomplish this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure that your text is big enough (over 16px).</li>
            <li>Have a strong contrast between the foreground and the background.</li>
            <li>Make sure there is enough space between lines and letters (remember, whitespace is king!)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Text Navigability</h2>
        <p>It’s also important for a user to immediately know how to navigate your text. It should be clear what
            they can click, and where it will take them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stick to conventions about showing what is clickable (generally, links should be blue and underlined).
                Underlining links is less common now than a few years ago. It’s optional, but a nice courtesy to
                colorblind users.</li>
            <li>Never use blue as a general accent color for text, because your users will probably try to click on
                it no matter what.</li>
            <li>Having text on navigation buttons is important. It removes all uncertainty about what each button
                does.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Text Length, Columns and Line Length</h2>
        <p>The way users consume text on the internet is different from traditional text. Users rarely read web pages,
            especially if there are large blocks of text.</p>
        <p>Because of this, you want to make it as easy as possible for a user to read your text. You may be used to
            writing 5-paragraph sentences when you were in school, but that’s too long! The average internet paragraph
            is only 1-3 sentences. It’s actually better to avoid sentences and paragraphs whenever possible and use a
            list instead.</p>
        <p>Hitting a happy medium is key to having engaging text content. The best bet is to aim to have columns that
            contain roughly 50-75 characters per line. This will allow the reader to have the sensation of making good
            progress through the text without being continually interrupted by the line breaks.</p>
        <p>Line length has a larger impact than you would expect on the reader. Each time a reader gets to a new line
            the mind is slightly energized and encouraged. But if the line lengths are too
            short, then the reader will be constantly taken out of the flow of the content by the quick succession of
            line breaks.</p>
        <h2>Using neurological behavior in your favor</h2>
        <p><strong>What do you want your users to take away from the text on your website?</strong> Would you rather
            they remember a description of where a product was built or would you rather they remember the benefits
            the product will give them if they buy it.</p>
        <p><strong>Where do you want the user’s eyes to immediately focus when they open the page?</strong> Would you
            rather they be drawn to the navigation bar at the top, or do you want them to immediately focus on the
            articles that are featured on the homepage.</p>
        <p>People will notice and remember the first and last elements of a list or a page better than anything
            in the middle of the list/page. This is known as <strong>Primacy and Recency effects</strong>. You can
            utilize this neurological behavior when organizing the text on your site to make sure that users remember
            what you want them to remember.</p>
        <p>Users eyes are easily drawn to image quicker than they are to text. You can utilize this by pairing
            important text with images whenever appropriate.</p>
        <p>Users will scan content on the left of the screen before the right of the screen, and the top of the screen
            before the bottom of the screen. Our eyes jump back to the left of the screen whenever we finish reading a
            line. This creates an F pattern that the user’s eye follows, and is thus known as <strong>f-shaped skimming.
            </strong></p>
