        <h2>Buttons</h2>
        <p>Buttons are another fundamental element of user interaction and navigation. They are called <i>buttons</i>
            because they are often modeled on the appearance and behavior of real-life buttons. The concept of UI
            elements that replicate or imitate real-life counterparts is known as <i>skeuomorphism</i>.</p>
        <p>In design, <i>skeuomorphism</i> is helpful for lowering the learning curve for users. If users can draw
            a metaphor between a familiar real-life object and an interface element, they are more likely to know
            how to use it without training.</p>
        <p><i>Flat design</i> is an alternative approach to <i>skeuomorphism</i> which embraces the fact that computer
            interfaces do not necessarily need to model real-life interfaces. As users grow more familiar with digital
            displays and interfaces, designers have felt less need to model physical interactions and instead rely on
            other signifiers to indicate interactive elements. To generalize, flat design uses simplicity and lack of
            clutter for its UI elements.</p>
        <p><i>skeuomorphism</i> button design can be implemented using image files, CSS rules, or a combination of both.
            CSS styles should be preferred over image files if possible, since they are faster to load, have smaller
            file sizes, and allow for a more consistent scaling and appearance across different screen sizes and
            resolutions. Modern CSS3 has support for many 2-D and 3-D effects and animations and can create many
            <i>skeuomorphism</i> button designs on its own.</p>

        <p><i>Flat design</i> buttons commonly appear as rectangles, rounded rectangles, or circles. These shapes are
            used ubiquitously for button elements, so users often perceive them as buttons and expect them to be
            clickable.</p>
