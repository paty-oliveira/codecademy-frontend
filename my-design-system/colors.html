            <h2>Color Theory</h2>
            <p>If you’ve taken an art class, it’s likely that you’ve been introduced to the color wheel.
                This is a tool used by artists and designers to visualize the relationship between colors.
                It’s comprised of three color groups: primary, secondary and tertiary.</p>
            <p>Primary colors are comprised of red, blue and yellow. These are equidistant to each other
                on the wheel, forming a triangle. They are also the basis for all other colors on the wheel.</p>
            <p>Secondary colors are created by mixing two primary colors, forming green, orange and purple.</p>
            <p>The third and final group of colors are considered to be tertiary and are formed when mixing a
                secondary and primary. These usually result in a two-word name, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Red-orange (Vermillion)</li>
                <li>Yellow-orange (Amber)</li>
                <li>Yellow-green (Chartreuse)</li>
                <li>Blue-green (Teal)</li>
                <li>Blue-purple (Violet)</li>
                <li>Red-purple (Magenta)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Warm Colors</h2>
            <p>Warm colors range between red and yellow, which include various versions of those colors in addition
                to orange. This also comprises colors such as brown and tan. These are considered to be “warm” colors
                in that they evoke a sense of warmth. For instance, fire is associated with warmth, and it typically
                burns between the spectrum of reds and yellows.</p>
            <p>Warm colors can also promote a feeling of aggression
                and are considered bold.</p>
            <h2>Cool Colors</h2>
            <p>On the other side of the color wheel in contrast to warm colors, there are colors that are considered
                to be “cool”. These colors range between blue, purple and green. Most gray colors fall into the cool
                category as well.</p>
            <p>Cool colors are given this designation because of their calming, soothing nature. They’re often
                associated with winter climates or water.</p>
            <h2>Tints and Shades</h2>
            <p>You can also increase and decrease the lightness of a color, resulting in tints and shades of a hue,
                respectively.</p>
            <p>Tints occur when white is applied to a color, adding or increasing the lightness of a hue.</p>
            <p>Shades are created when black is added to a color, which decreases the lightness of a hue.</p>
            <h2>Color Contrast</h2>
            <p>When applying color to your designs, it’s vital to ensure contrast levels provide clarity to the users
                for the elements on your page. For instance, you wouldn’t want to use a light color on a white
                background or a detailed background. It’s essential to try and increase the contrast of your designs
                in order to promote ease of use and legibility.</p>
            <p>This is also the reason why you often see dark gray or black text on a white background. The high
                contrast between the two colors provides the best ability for users to read the information without
                any difficulty.</p>
            <h2>Color Schemes</h2>
            <p>As a designer, it’s vital to understand how properly harmonizing colors will enable you to create
                elegant and usable designs. The color wheel comes in handy when deciding which colors might fit with
                one another, and using it can allow you to create a variety of color schemes.</p>
            <p>Color schemes (or color palettes) are the result of pairing two or more colors together. The colors
                you select can make or break your design, however, knowing your options will put you in a better
                place to determine what is best for moving forward.</p>
            <p>When deciding which colors to use in your design, there are four different color schemes to consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monochromatic</li>
                <li>Complementary</li>
                <li>Analogous</li>
                <li>Triadic</li>
            </ul>
            <figure>
                <img src="resources/images/color-schemes.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Color schemes.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>These monochromatic color schemes are beneficial in that they provide an organized impression when
                applied to your designs. The use of a single color can provide an immediate sense of harmony.</p>
            <p>Complementary color palettes are very common in logos and uniforms.</p>
            <p>Analogous color schemes create a visually pleasing and calming display. For instance, the color blue
                can pair nicely with both teal and green. However, analogous color schemes provide a low-contrast
                experience, since all colors fall in line with one another.</p>
            <p>They shouldn’t be used for content that needs the user’s direct attention, but they can be used to
                create backgrounds that do not compete with the main content of the site.</p>
            <p>Triadic color schemes are useful in that they create a sense of equality, vibrancy, and security in
                your designs.</p>
            <h2>Color Psychology</h2>
            <p>Every color has a different context and meaning, and color psychology can impact how people perceive
                a design and relate to the colors used. Choosing the right colors can help nonverbal
                communicate the context and emotion of a product or service.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            <p>Now that we’ve talked through how to choose the proper colors for your designs, there are some best
                practices considering as well.</p>
            <p><strong>Use neon colors sparingly</strong>. While the use of neon colors can feel hip, they are often
                hard on a user’s eyes.</p>
            <p><strong>Avoid vibrating colors.</strong> Vibrating colors result from pairing two colors with high
                saturation together that may be complementary to one another. It creates a glowing or moving effect,
                which also can be hard on one’s eyes.</p>
            <p><strong>Use backdrops to separate vibrating colors</strong>. In the example, the white backdrop behind
                the green card reduces the space where the contrasting colors (red and green) are directly next to each
                other, but the overall effect is still too intense for most websites</p>
            <p><strong>Avoid color combinations with insufficient contrast</strong>, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bright colors on top of bright colors</li>
                <li>Light colors on top of light colors</li>
                <li>Dark colors on top of dark colors</li>
            </ul>
