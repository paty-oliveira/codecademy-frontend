# Rooster Regulation

An experimental rooster object has been developed without any tests! Itâ€™s up to you to write them.

By the end of this project you will have a fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive test suite: it will provide confidence that the rooster is functioning correctly and it will act as a form of documentation for other developers.
