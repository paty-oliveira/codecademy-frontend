# Journey Around the World

**Description:** In this project, you will use the knowledge you gained on color theory and apply it to a simple 
web page. 
You will take an existing grayscale website, select a color scheme, and apply the colors to various elements 
and sections within the design.

This means you will need to consider how to select your color scheme, adhere to proper contrast of elements, 
and carefully apply those colors to the page to create an elegant design.
